This list is a timeline. Time forward means moving downwards along the list.
Which means that Tasks are listed in reverse order, instead of below their corresponding title.

Comments/Description right under a label are relevant only to the label right above  (not the content after)
  : (the list/content belongs to the next roadmap label).
