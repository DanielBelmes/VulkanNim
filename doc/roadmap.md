# Notes
? ? ? versions mean that their number has not been decided.

This list is a timeline. Time forward means moving downwards along the list.
Which means that Tasks are listed in reverse order, instead of below their corresponding title.
 -> To arrive at 0.9.0, all previously listed tasks must be completed.
  : Tasks listed under its label are meant for the next step (1.0.0) not for 0.9.0

Comments/Description right under a label are relevant only to the label right above  (not the content after)
  : (the list/content belongs to the next roadmap label).

# 0.9.0 Codegen (Untested/Beta)
Effort on testing the generated bindings code starts after this is complete.  
```


```md
- [ ] ...
# 1.0.0 Simple Bindings complete
Bindings work like before, no nim extras.
Good enough to replace the existing `vulkan` bindings.
```


```md
# 2.0.0 Nim'ified bindings, without ergonomic initialization tools
Bindings can be used in a pure Nim way, without any direct C-like interaction with the background layers.  
All objects have constructors that take optional default values, and are type-safe.  
```


```md
- [ ] vkb::___Builder type and procs
- [ ] vkb::___Type resulting types and procs
- [ ] vkb::___Type.value() to access the raw handles/data generated by vulkan
- [ ] vkb::___Type : Functionality to be usable with the library as they are
# 3.0.0 vk-bootstrap-like interface for initialization
Bindings can be used to easily initialize Vulkan in a minimal and ergonomic way, just like with vk-bootstrap.
Need to figure out if there is anything else worth implementing for the bindings after this.  
```
